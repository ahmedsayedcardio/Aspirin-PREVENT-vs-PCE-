This repository has a Quarto file containing the R code necessary to reproduce an analysis estimating the clinical implications of using the Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events (PREVENT)
rather than the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) 10-year ASCVD risk estimates for using aspirin for primary prevention. The files here are sufficient to reproduce the graphical figures and numerical results
obtained in the manuscript when used alongside the corresponding NHANES files. 

Please note that you will need to download NHANES files (2015-2020): https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx
Afterwards, you need to place the downloaded files into their respective folder names in a directory of your choosing and direct R to access the files from this directory. Instructions for this are present in the
"Import" heading of the Quarto file herein. 

Also, please note that this code reflects the analysis at the *time of submission*, and may not incorporate all of the additions and subtractions present in the final (accepted) work.

Should you have any questions related to this analysis, please do not hesitate to reach out via email (asu.ahmed.sayed@gmail.com)
